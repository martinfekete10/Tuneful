## Important
Please note the newest version of Tuneful is available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tuneful/id6739804295?mt=12) only. I made Tuneful paid to help cover at least a portion of the time I've invested in the development, as well as some of the additional costs (such as the $100/year Apple Developer License fee).

You’re welcome to compile Tuneful from the source code available in this repository. However, the compiled version won’t include the features and fixes added since `v2.0.0`, such as:
- Notch player inspired by Dynamic Island
- More fluid and native UI with smoother animations
- New mini player and menu bar player types
- Trackpad integration with swipe gestures
- More customization options
- Many bug fixes and performance improvements

If you wish to support the development of Tuneful by purchasing from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tuneful/id6739804295?mt=12) and receive the newest updates, I'll be thankful. The price is set to $3.99, which I believe should be affordable for majority of people.
